# Glossary

Define each term below by writing a paragraph explaining what it is and why it's important for web development. Include 2-3 relevant links for more information.

## Web Components
Web Components are a set of native browser standards that allow developers to create reusable, encapsulated custom HTML elements. They are built using technologies like Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, and HTML Templates, which work together to isolate structure, style, and behavior. Web Components are important for web development because they promote modularity, consistency, and reusability across projects without relying on a specific JavaScript framework. Since they are supported by modern browsers, they help future-proof applications and make components easier to share across teams and platforms.

## Lit
Lit is a lightweight JavaScript library designed to help developers build fast, efficient Web Components with minimal boilerplate. It simplifies templating, reactivity, and component lifecycle management while still leveraging standard Web Components under the hood. Lit is important for web development because it provides the convenience of a framework without sacrificing performance or browser-native standards, making it ideal for scalable and maintainable component-based architectures.

## NPM
NPM (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for JavaScript and is used to install, manage, and share reusable code libraries. It allows developers to quickly add tools, frameworks, and dependencies to their projects, such as Lit, React, or build tools like Vite and Webpack. NPM is important for web development because it streamlines dependency management, enables collaboration, and supports modern development workflows by making it easy to reuse and update code.

## Node.js
Node.js is essentially what runs JavaScript, It is what 'does' stuff within the file. It is a high performance, single-threaded event loop that is very popular for building modern web applications.It is also known for it's scalability and for having an extensive ecosystem:
*Event-Driven, non-blocking I/O = great for real time applications
*Collection of libraries making development easier

## JavaScript
JavaScript is a high-level programming language used to add interactivity, logic, and dynamic behavior to websites. It runs in the browser and allows developers to respond to user actions, manipulate HTML and CSS, fetch data from servers, and build complex applications. JavaScript is essential for web development because it powers everything from simple form validation to full-scale web applications and frameworks. Technologies like Web Components, Lit, and NPM-based tools all rely on JavaScript, making it the core language that connects structure, style, and functionality on the modern web.

## Git
Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in code over time and coordinate work among multiple developers. It allows developers to create branches, merge changes, revert mistakes, and maintain a complete history of a project. Git is essential for web development because it supports collaboration, protects code from accidental loss, and integrates with platforms like GitHub and GitLab for code reviews, deployment, and team workflows.

## HAXTheWeb
HAXTheWeb is an open-source web component ecosystem and content authoring system developed at Penn State. It uses Web Components and Lit to allow users to create, edit, and publish web content visually while still producing clean, standards-based HTML. HAXTheWeb is important for web development because it demonstrates how modern Web Components can power flexible content management systems, bridge the gap between developers and non-technical users, and promote reusable, accessible design patterns.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

A Command Line Interface is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a computer program, operating system, or development tool by typing commands into a terminal or console, rather than using graphical user interfaces.
